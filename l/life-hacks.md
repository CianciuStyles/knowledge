# Life Hacks

### House

#### Kitchen

* Put your onion in the freezer for 10 minutes before chopping it. It freezes the juices just enough to slow down the process of it turning in to a gas, giving you a few minutes to chop the onion without tears.

#### Bathroom

* Use hand sanitiser (or glycolic acid) after shower to stop armpits smelling
* Use shaving cream as anti-fog for mirrors
* Vinegar in a plastic bag with rubber band tied around any faucet will make the faucet like-new.



* Sleep on big decisions.
* Use makeup remover wipes (or denim, or dryer sheets) to remove deodorant stains on shirts.
