# Curriculum Vitae

* The goal of the CV is to sell you enough to get a recruiter phone call and continue the process
* You should choose a CV format that helps highlight the key information the recruiter looks for in the first scan. A good CV template follows these principles:
  * Single column
  * Dates, position name, and company name are all separated
  * Your location and languages/technologies are easy to find
* When you have experience, here is what will be most relevant:
  * Work experience
  * Languages and technologies you're proficient with
  * Education details
  * Extracurricular things - patents, talks, open source contributions
  * Certifications
  * Personal projects
* To make it clear what languages and technologies you're proficient with:
  * have a separate section in the first page of the CV
  * call out languages and technologies used as part of work experience
* To stand out, be specific. To be specific, follow this approach:
  * Use numbers and quantify whenever you can - number of users, service load numbers, customer support tickets you proactively resolved
  * Use active language that shows what you have done and how you have been proactive
  * Mention specific languages and technologies where they make sense
*   A few things that can greatly help your job search are:

    * employee referrals: the best way to increase your chances of hearing back from a company. Ask around in your network or public forums where tech professionals gather (Twitter/LinkedIn/Blind)
    * cover letters: a coin toss - larger companies usually don't ask for one or don't pay much attention to it; at smaller firms and startups, it's a better investment to spend time on
    * LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow: having an up-to-date profile will greatly help your job search. Refresh the LinkedIn profile as you write your resume. On GitHub, create a README to present yourself and your key projects more effectively. On Stack Overflow, tailor your Developer Story to make it easy for recruiters to find you with relevant opportunities
