### Introduction to Negotiation - Barry Nalebuff

#### Week 1

* The **pie** is the reason the negotiation is taking place. It's what the parties are trying to divide. The first question almost everyone asks is, how do you divide it? In particular, how do you get as big a slice as possible? Now that's a fine question, and I'll help you answer it, but it isn't where I start. My starting point is **what is the pie**?
* The pie is how much more two parties, A and B, can achieve by working together than they can get if they don't reach an agreement.
* In more technical terms, the pie = **net benefit from working together – \(A’s net benefit on its own + B’s net benefit on its own\)** where net benefit is the benefit leftover after costs.
* The **Principle of the Divided Cloth** says to give each party what has been conceded to him by the other and then split the amount in dispute.
* In a multi-side negotiation, the **Shapley value** tries to make things fair by averaging costs across all possible orderings.
