# Focus

## Notes

* Don't try to do everything at once. Pick one thing to go after, then move onto the next thing.
* "If you want to have a hyper-focus on anything in life, by definition you have to neglect other things. You only have so much attention to slice and dice" - [Tim Ferriss](https://twitter.com/tferriss)
* "Our mindstate is the first thing holding us back from getting the results we want" - [Greg McKeown](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKeown)
* “When we focus on what we lack, we lose what we have, when we focus on what we have, we gain what we lack” - [Greg McKeown](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKeown)
