### 7 Surprising Ways to Speed Up Fat-Burning (AND LOSE WEIGHT FASTER) - Dr. Eric Berg DC

1. Exercise less but with more intensity (HIIT)
   * Fat burning happens when resting, not when exercising
   * Over-training could block fat loss
2. Drink one tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) in water one hour before bed
   * Slows down glyconeogenesis, which is the ability of the liver to create new sugars
3. Better sleep
   * Vitamin D3 and B1 before bed
   * Taking a 30 minute nap during the day
4. Lower stress
   * Stress increases cortisol, cortisol increases insulin, insulin stops fat loss
   * Get exposure to sun (especially in the morning) increases melatonin, which helps lowering cortisol
   * Doing physical work in the house/yard helps way more to lower stress than physical exercise
5. Consistent with low carb
   * A1C tests check the average of the last 3 months
6. Intermittent fasting
   * Consuming more fat at the beginning of a fasting program helps to fast for longer periods of time
7. Nutrient dense keto foods

### How to ACTUALLY Lose Belly Fat (Based On Science) - Jeremy Ethier

* The key to losing belly fat is getting into a caloric deficit consistently and doing it for long enough
* You should be eating the 20 foods you like the most, because that would help you stick with the diet, but those 20 foods need to be drawn from the main six groups (high protein, fats, vegetable, starch, milk, fruits) - usually 3 from each group, with two wild cards
* Protein has the highest energetic cost of processing within the body
* Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) is the second largest contributor to daily energy expenditure
* Sleep is also important when it comes to losing weight - studies have shown that people that sleep at least 7 hours per night lose more belly fat and less muscle than people sleeping 5 hours per night
