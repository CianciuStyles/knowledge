    * It's very clear from both animal and human studies that time-restricted feeding can have a very powerful and positive impact
    * When you eat is _as important as_ what you eat
    * It's very important that the feeding window happens during the more active phase of the day - eating during the nocturnal phase of the 24-hour cycle is detrimental
    * Don't have food for the first hour after you wake up, and the two/three hours before bedtime
    * It's best to extend the sleep related fast either into the morning or start it in the evening
    * Alternate day fasting (eating one day, fasting the following day) seems to be the most effective for weight loss and blood glucose regulation

    1. Exercise less but with more intensity (HIIT)
       * Fat burning happens when resting, not when exercising
       * Over-training could block fat loss
    2. Drink one tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) in water one hour before bed
       * Slows down glyconeogenesis, which is the ability of the liver to create new sugars
    3. Better sleep
       * Vitamin D3 and B1 before bed
       * Taking a 30 minute nap during the day
    4. Lower stress
       * Stress increases cortisol, cortisol increases insulin, insulin stops fat loss
       * Get exposure to sun (especially in the morning) increases melatonin, which helps lowering cortisol
       * Doing physical work in the house/yard helps way more to lower stress than physical exercise
    5. Consistent with low carb
       * A1C tests check the average of the last 3 months
    6. Intermittent fasting
       * Consuming more fat at the beginning of a fasting program helps to fast for longer periods of time
    7. Nutrient dense keto foods

  * [How to ACTUALLY Lose Belly Fat (Based on Science)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok-AZtt33Bo)
    * The key to losing belly fat is getting into a caloric deficit consistently and doing it for long enough
    * You should be eating the 20 foods you like the most, because that would help you stick with the diet, but those 20 foods need to be drawn from the main six groups (high protein, fats, vegetable, starch, milk, fruits) - usually 3 from each group, with two wild cards
    * Protein has the highest energetic cost of processing within the body
    * Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT) is the second largest contributor to daily energy expenditure
    * Sleep is also important when it comes to losing weight - studies have shown that people that sleep at least 7 hours per night lose more belly fat and less muscle than people sleeping 5 hours per night
