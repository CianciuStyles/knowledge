## Notes

* Ketosis is when you have a blood concentration of ketones greater or equal to 0.5mmol.
* The ketogenic diet mimics the physiological state of fasting by suppressing insulin and raising blood ketone levels.
* The ketogenic diet works because it's non-glycemic - we control our appetite instead of our appetite controlling us.
