# Exercise

## Notes

* When it comes to working out, consistency beats intensity.
* The #1 Exercise to Lose Belly Fat (Easily) - Dr. Eric Berg DC
  * Walking consumes 200 to 300 calories per hour - it does not sound a lot but walking reduces cortisol and adrenaline, which significantly improves insulin resistance
  * The first 30 minutes will be burning glycogen (sugar stored in the body), after that you will be burning pure fat
  * So the ideal would be to walk between 1 and 2 hours daily, or 8000 to 10000 steps

  * [Is It Safe To Workout While Fasting?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWSI3xXV3fc)
    * Energy does not come from the food you just ate but from nutrient pools: glycogen (that can last for 12-24 hours), fat (1-12 months), vitamins B1/D (years), protein (weeks)
    * For aerobic exercise (low intensity), it is absolutely safe
    * For anaerobic exercise (higher intensity), it is safe if you're fat adapted but you might feel weak if you are carb dependent
    * For weight lifting, you might want to eat after the workout ends because the body will try to rebuild the muscle after the breakdown that happens in the workout but won't have the necessary resources
