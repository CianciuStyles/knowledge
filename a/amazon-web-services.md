# Amazon Web Services

## Notes

### Relational Database Service (RDS)

* It allows you to spin up a relational database and have Amazon take care of the upgrades/patches/backups/etc. (database-as-a-service)
* RDS instances are approximately double the price of an equivalent EC2 instance where you could self-host your RDBMS, but you'll most likely save money on developer time around managing the database
* Supported databases are:
  * MySQL
  * Postgres
  * MariaDB
  * Oracle (more expensive due to licensing fees)
  * SQL Server (more expensive due to licensing fees)
  * Amazon Aurora (fully compatible with Postgres and MySQL)
