# Behavioural Interviews

* **Behavioral questions are the gold standard**; theyâ€™re the most effective at predicting job performance.
* **Behavioral questions** are ones where you ask a candidate to tell you about some situation in the past, and how they behaved (what they said, what they did, etc.).
* **Hypothetical questions** aren't as valuable as behavioral ones: people are often terrible at predicting their own future behavior. But, there are times when they can be useful, as in this example where the specific approach to _this_ company was important to understand.
* The best way to use hypothetical questions is by pairing them with behavioral ones.
