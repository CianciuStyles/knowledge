## Notes

### 30 Days to Better Habits - James Clear

#### How to Choose a Habit that Sticks

* It is much more important to work on the right habit than it is to work really hard.
* Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.
* Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
* Your habits reshape your identty in a gradual way.

#### The Two-Minute Rule for Building Lasting Habits

* When you're trying to build a new habit, it's easy to start too big.
* The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
* A habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details.

#### How to Fit New Habits in Your Life

* Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action.
* One effective way to insert a new habit into your life is with an “**implementation intention.”** An implementation intention is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement your habit. Scientists have found that if you make an implementation intention, you are more likely to follow through with your plans and stick to your habits.
*   The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:

    _I will \[BEHAVIOR] at \[TIME] in \[LOCATION]._

#### How to Design Your Environment for Success

* Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice the cues that stand out. Creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward your desired habit. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make it easy to not do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the behavior.
* We can summarize this strategy as follows: If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, you need to make the cue a big part of your environment. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one. In the long-run (and often in the short-run), your willpower will not beat your environment. You can alter the spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive cues. Making a better decision is easy, natural even, when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.

#### How to Make Good Habits Automatic

* You can also optimize your environment to make the actions themselves easier to perform. This process can be called “**reducing friction**”. The less friction associated with a habit, the more likely it is to occur.
* When deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life.
* The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. You want to make your good habits the path of least resistance.
* The ultimate way to reduce friction is to use technology and automation. This is exactly what many popular businesses are designed to do. Just as businesses use technology to automate the behavior of the masses, you can use technology to automate your own behavior.

### Atomic Habits - James Clear

* Each time you successfully do a habit, you will find it less effortful to do the next time.
* The most important thing is to make it as easy as possible to start a new habit; after that you will start benefitting from the powerful compounding effect.
* Make sure the habit only takes 2 minutes to start with; you can increase the time later.
* Habit stacking happens when you attach a new habit to a pre-existing one - e.g., if you want to read 2 minutes a day and you already have breakfast each morning, try reading 2 minutes right after the breakfast
* Reward yourself after completing the habit. This will give you a small dopamine hit, which will make it more likely for you to repeat the habit in the future.
* Reduce friction for good habits - e.g., leave your gym shorts out overnight if you want to go to the gym in the morning.
* Reduce exposure to the cue for bad habits - e.g., if you want to stop smoking and you noticed you always do it when drinking coffee in the garden, then stop drinking coffee in the garden. Time and location are the 2 most common cues.
* It is much easier to avoid temptation than to resist it, so just avoid situations in which you know you will be tempted if you can.

### How to Get Back on Track After Slipping Up (Habits, Diet, etc.) - Tim Ferriss

* Expect to fall off the track at some point - but have a plan for when that happens
* Doing anything with a friend for accountability - and put some money on the line (even $1 bets work well)
* Have a "start again" meditation
* Do less than you think you can handle - you can always add more later
