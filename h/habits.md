# Habits

## Notes

### Atomic Habits - James Clear

* Each time you successfully do a habit, you will find it less effortful to do the next time.
* The most important thing is to make it as easy as possible to start a new habit; after that you will start benefitting from the powerful compounding effect.
* Make sure the habit only takes 2 minutes to start with; you can increase the time later.
* Habit stacking happens when you attach a new habit to a pre-existing one - e.g., if you want to read 2 minutes a day and you already have breakfast each morning, try reading 2 minutes right after the breakfast
* Reward yourself after completing the habit. This will give you a small dopamine hit, which will make it more likely for you to repeat the habit in the future.
* Reduce friction for good habits - e.g., leave your gym shorts out overnight if you want to go to the gym in the morning.
* Reduce exposure to the cue for bad habits - e.g., if you want to stop smoking and you noticed you always do it when drinking coffee in the garden, then stop drinking coffee in the garden. Time and location are the 2 most common cues.
* It is much easier to avoid temptation than to resist it, so just avoid situations in which you know you will be tempted if you can.

### How to Get Back on Track After Slipping Up \(Habits, Diet, etc.\) - Tim Ferriss

* Expect to fall off the track at some point - but have a plan for when that happens
* Doing anything with a friend for accountability - and put some money on the line \(even $1 bets work well\)
* Have a "start again" meditation
* Do less than you think you can handle - you can always add more later
