# Productivity

## Notes

* Busy = out of control
* Effortless action is about asking a few questions to simplify your projects. When projects or problems are unclear in our mind we feel overwhelmed.
* Even if you can't do something, you can seek help or assistance from others to get something done.
* "If you can’t work any harder, you gotta find an easier path” - [Greg McKeown](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKeown)
* Three key productivity hacks: forgiveness, gratitude, and asking "how can I do this effortlessly" - [Greg McKeown](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKeown)
* “What is one thing that is absolutely essential that I’m underinvesting on right now?” - [Greg McKeown](https://twitter.com/GregoryMcKeown)
* When given an opton of doing something, it should be either a Hell Yes or a No. - [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/)

### Getting Things Done - David Allen

* Your brain is for having ideas, not holding them.
* Five simple steps:
  * Capture: emails, action items, everything that needs to be done
  * Process: is it actionable?
    * if yes - if it takes less than two minutes do it straight away; if it takes longer than two minutes, add it to the action list
    * if no - discard it or keep it as a reference
  * Organise: what is the next action?
    * If action is time-specific or has a deadline, it should go in the calendar
    * Actions that are connected to the same project should go together
    * Actions should be divided int contexts, so you can look at them only when you can action them
  * Review: a weekly review in which you make adjustments is essential to keep things work smoothly. Every month take some time to review your short-term goals
  * Engage: let's get cracking!
