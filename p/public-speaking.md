# Public Speaking

## Notes

* Don't be afraid of slowing down a conversation (especially one about engineering).
* You're not speaking to a group, you're speaking to each individual in a group. Always focus on someone briefly, including eye contact, and then on someone else.
* It's easiest to talk well about things you're confident about.
* Theory is great but practice is better. Find and join a Toastmaster club in your area or online.
* If you use slides, do **not** read the slides to your audience. It's a waste of time: they can read, and they can read faster than you can talk.
* Focus on the on the broad themes and concepts without trying to remember a specific sequence of words.
